# phpquery
I need to use php to retrieve video links from my Vimeo website.  My plan is based on bdougherty's vimeo code. 
But he has the php code embedded in the DOM in a way that I have been unable to make flexible. 

I want to put thumbnails and links to the vimeo videos in the DOM. The number of videos changes with time so the 
HTML needs to be flexible. I use Php to sort the albums. I am working on getting this information into javascript 
using jQuery. phpquery might be able to help me.
